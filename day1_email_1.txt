I'm so glad to hear that!! Told ya it would work perfectly
That's why I love this company so much, no need to buy the latest version all models are compatible
& we love saving money arent we lol

Also a friend of mine said the eye problems can be easily fixed by disconnecting its local 
processor & using the brain one
But do u even need all the eye analysis functions ?? 

The only bad news: now that youre done with building n stuff you have to work on the AI full time 
lol good luck

Reach out when u need help
Love u
