milemans.gia@aileading.com
Hi, my name is Gia Milemans and I work at AILeading.com
In case you have'nt heard about us, we are an independant news website focused on AI innovation 
led by small creators.

We've been hearing a lot about your work on the Azura 1500 set and we are impressed by your work! 
Our incomming issue happens to be focused on industrial robot hijacks and since you are one of the 
leading creator of the community, we'd love to feature an article about your work.

The format of our articles can take various shape, our initial thought is to feature an interview, 
your current results and few pictures. But if you're interested in working with us, we shall discuss 
about it to find the perfect format for both you and us.

Looking forward to working with you,
AILeading.com representative
Gia Milemans
